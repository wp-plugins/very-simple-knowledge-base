== DESCRIPTION ==
This is a very simple plugin to create a responsive Knowledge Base, Bulletin Board, FAQ, Wiki or Weblink Portal. 

It uses the default WP categories and posts. 

Use shortcode [knowledgebase-three] or [knowledgebase] to display your categories and posts in 3 or 4 columns on a page. In mobile screens 2 columns.

For more info please check readme file.


== INSTALLATION == 
After installation create a page and add shortcode [knowledgebase-three] or [knowledgebase]. 

Now this page will display your categories and posts in 3 or 4 columns. In mobile screens 2 columns.

That's all!


== Screenshots == 
1. Very Simple Knowledge Base in Twenty Twelve theme.
2. Very Simple Knowledge Base in mobile version of Twenty Twelve theme (in mobile screens 2 columns).


== OTHER NOTES ==
Because I used css selector 'nth-of-type' it might not display 100% in IE8 and older.

This plugin is translation-ready (Dutch translation included). Only things that can be translated are dashboard name and plugin description.

More translations are very welcome! Please contact me via my website.

You can translate this into your own language using for example plugin Codestyling Localization:

== CREDITS ==
Without the WordPress codex and help from the WordPress community I was not able to develop this plugin, so: thank you!

A special thank you to Niels van Renselaar for helping me with the shortcode.

Enjoy,
Guido
