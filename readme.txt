== OTHER NOTES ==
Because I used css selector 'nth-of-type' it might not display 100% in IE8 and older.
This plugin is translation-ready (Dutch translation included). More translations are very welcome! Please send them to: info@guidovanderleest.nl
You can translate this into your own language using for example plugin Codestyling Localization: http://wordpress.org/plugins/codestyling-localization/


== CREDITS ==
Without the WordPress codex and help from the WordPress community I was not able to develop this plugin, so: thank you!
Special thanks to Niels van Renselaar for helping me with the shortcode.

Enjoy,
Guido
