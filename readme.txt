== DESCRIPTION ==
This is a very simple plugin to create a responsive Knowledge Base, Bulletin Board, FAQ, Wiki or Weblink Portal. 

It uses the default WP categories and posts. 

Use shortcode [knowledgebase-three] or [knowledgebase] to display your PARENT CATEGORIES and all posts in 3 or 4 columns on a page. 

Use shortcode [knowledgebase-three-subcats] or [knowledgebase-subcats] to display your PARENT AND SUB CATEGORIES and all posts in 3 or 4 columns on a page.

In mobile screens 2 columns.

Because I have used css selector 'nth-of-type' it might not display 100% in IE8 and older.

Question? Please take a look at the FAQ section.


= Translation =
Dutch translation included. Only things that can be translated are dashboard name and plugin description. More translations are very welcome! Please contact me via my website.

= CREDITS =
Without the WordPress codex and help from the WordPress community I was not able to develop this plugin, so: thank you!

A special thank you to Niels van Renselaar and PDO team for helping me with the shortcode.

Enjoy,
Guido
